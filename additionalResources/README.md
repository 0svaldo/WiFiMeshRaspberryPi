# Additional Resources

This section provides additional information, will get you up to speed with the prerequisite knowledge and the setup.

## Prerequisites and setup

Before you start the workshop you need to have the required hardware and software installed and have your IBM public cloud account.  Full details can be found on the [Setup](/additionalResources/PREREQUISITES_AND_SETUP.md) page.

## Headerless setup

When setting up a Raspberry Pi you need to access the Pi to do the initial setup.  This is usually done by connecting a keyboard, mouse and monitor to the Pi.  However, it is possible to setup the pi using a computer without needing to connect the keyboard, mouse and monitor.  This is known as a headerless setup.  Full details can be found on doing a headerless setup on [this page](/additionalResources/HEADERLESS_SETUP.md)

## Command line access to a Raspberry Pi

Throughout the workshop you need to get access to the command line of the Raspberry Pi board that make up the mesh network.  [this page](COMMAND_LINE_ACCESS.md) provides information how to do this from Linux, MacOS and Windows systems.
