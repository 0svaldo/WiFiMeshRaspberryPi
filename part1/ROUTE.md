# Part 1 - Network Access

In the previous section you configured your raspberry pi systems to create a mesh network.  Before we start up the mesh network we need to make sure you will be able to access the devices forming the mesh and also allow the mesh devices to access the Internet.

In this section you will add a gateway device to allow the mesh traffic to be routed to the Internet, but keeping the mesh network private from your home or office network.  You will also create a bridge device to allow your laptop or any other device to access mesh devices or access the Internet via the mesh network.

## Gateways and bridges

This workshop shows 2 different ways of connecting netowrks.  A Gateway device and a bridge device, so what is the difference?

A Gateway:
- hides the second network (the mesh network in diagram above) from the primary network (home/office network in diagram)
- appears on the primary network as a standard device and by default prevents other devices on the primary network seeing devices on the second network
- allows devices on the second network to see devices on the primary network using a technique called Network Address Translation (NAT), which sends all traffic originating on the second network destined for the primary network (or Internet) as if it had been generated by the gateway device, then when a response is received it *translates* the destination address to the originating device on the second network.
- not all traffic from the primary network is sent to the second network.  By default, only responses to traffic originating on the second network is forwarded by the gateway, though additional rules can be added to allow other traffic to be routed from the primary network to the second network.
- the devices on the second network need to have a different IP address range, so the gateway can determine how to route traffic
- most home and office internet access devices are gateways, preventing internet traffic seeing into your home network, but allowing devices on your home network to access the internet.
- for more technical folks, this is a layer-3 routing solution (don't worry if your don't understand what this means)

A bridge:
- simply joins 2 different network interfaces and makes them appear to be a single network
- all network traffic flows across the bridge from both networks
- the 2 networks share the same IP address space, there is no routing
- for more technical folks, this is a layer-2 solution

You could choose to implement 2 bridges or 2 gateways depending on how you want to separate the networks.  The step-by-step instructions will implement a gateway and a bridge, as shown in the diagram above.

The instructions below will be using the Ethernet connection on a Pi 3B, if you can't use Ethernet and need to use WiFi then jump to part 2, where WiFi connectivity is covered (you will need additional WiFi USB dongles).
