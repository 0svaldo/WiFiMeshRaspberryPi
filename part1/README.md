# Part 1

In the first part of the workshop you will create a mesh network and then convert one of the nodes into a gateway to give all mesh nodes access to the internet.  You will also enable a non-mesh device, such as your computer to access the internet via the mesh by converting another mesh node to a bridge node.

Work through each of the sections in order to complete part 1:

## What is a mesh network?

Most wireless networks are formed in a star topology, but a Mesh network is where a number of devices form a network without needing a central hub device.  Explore mesh networks further in [this section](MESH.md)

## Create a mesh network over WiFi

Now you know the theory behind mesh networks in [this section](PIMESH.md) you will build a mesh network using Raspberry Pi boards.

## Gateway and Bridge nodes

To use the mesh network you just created you need to be able to access it and allow the nodes of the mesh network to access the internet.  In [this section](ROUTE.md) you will learn how to give the mesh network access to the internet and also how to allow non-mesh network devices to use the mesh as a way to access the internet and the nodes of the mesh network.
