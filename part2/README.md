# Part 2

In Part 1 of the workshop you created a mesh network, then part 1 showed you how to connect the mesh network to your home/office network using Ethernet.  It also showed how to bridge a non-mesh device to the mesh network, again using Ethernet.

In this part of the workshop you will see how to connect the gateway node to your home/office network using WiFi and also how to turn the bridge node into a WiFi hotspot, so you can bridge WiFi connected devices to the mesh network.

To complete the following sections you need to have additional WiFi USB dongle(s).

Having an additional WiFi interface connected to the Raspberry Pi does use more power, so ensure you have an adequate power supply for the Raspberry Pis.  Your laptop USB port may not supply enough power for the WiFi interfaces to work correctly.

If you do not need WiFi enabled gateway or bridge you can skip this part and move to [part 3](/part3/README.md)

## Connecting the gateway via WiFi

[This section](WIFIGW.md) shows you how to connect your gateway device to your home/office network using a second WiFi interface.

## Creating a bridge access point

[This section](WIFIBRDG.md) shows you how to create an access point on your bridge device then how to bridge the WiFi network created by the access point to the mesh network.
